Glucose trend interpretation rules (educational):

- Repeated post-meal glucose values above 180 mg/dL may indicate hyperglycemia.
- Large fluctuations between high and low glucose values indicate high variability.
- Rapid downward changes in glucose increase hypoglycemia risk.
- Persistent elevated glucose levels may require lifestyle or clinical review.

Do not diagnose or prescribe medication.
